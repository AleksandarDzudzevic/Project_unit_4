# Criteria A: Planning
## Problem Definition
Being in love with exploring small local shops and restaurants, visiting tourist atractions and everything else that a city has to offer, I have always faced a big challenge of finding them, as they can be hardly found on google maps where only few gain exposure, eliminating smaller local shops and restaurants due to their lack of marketing. Current social network gave these smaller businesses more exposure, but a user has to put a lot of effort to narrow the search only to relevant places in their city. If an adequate solution is not presented soon, these smaller businesses will close due to lack of trafic, resaulting in market concentration, which in turn would hurt city's economy and tourism. To tackle this issue I am proposing a new creative social network that would connect people located in the same city, and allow them to connect with others through sharing interesting places, culinary expiriences, astonsihing nature and everything one city has to offer.

## Design Statement
Design statement: I will to design and make a web aplication for social network for sharing interesting places in a city for a client who works in the office of the minister of tourism. The development will be done using the software Flusk feature in Python, CSS and HTML. It will take around 5 weeks to develop and will be evaluated according to the success criteria stated below by the client.

## Rationale for Proposed Solution
WHY 
## Success Criteria
1. The social network system website will distinguish and authorize users with an encrypted login system using SHA 256 encryption.
2. The social network system website will allow users to post their reviews of the local places.
3. The social network system website will have an option to choose a city which you are interested in, and see only relevant reviews.
4. The social network system website will have a feature to display all users and the city about which they post.
5. The social network system website will to have a feature to see all reviews posted by a specific user when selecting their profile.
6. The social media will allow a user signed in to permamently delete a specific post from their account.
