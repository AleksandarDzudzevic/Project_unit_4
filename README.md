# Criteria A: Planning
## Problem Definition
Being in love with exploring small local shops and restaurants, visiting tourist atractions and everything else that a city has to offer, I have always faced a big challenge of finding them, as they can be hardly found on google maps where only few gain exposure, eliminating smaller local shops and restaurants due to their lack of marketing. Current social network gave these smaller businesses more exposure, but a user has to put great effort to narrow the search only to relevant local places located in their city. If an adequate solution is not presented soon, these smaller businesses will close due to lack of trafic, resulting in market concentration, which in turn would hurt economy and tourism of cities. 

## Design Statement
To tackle this issue I will design a new creative social network that would allow people located in the same city to connect with others through sharing interesting local places, culinary expiriences, astonsihing nature and everything one city has to offer. The development will be done using the software Flask framework in Python, CSS and HTML. It will take around 5 weeks to develop and will be evaluated according to the success criteria stated below by the client.

## Rationale for Proposed Solution
WHY Python
Why database/sqlite
Why HTML
## Success Criteria
1. The social network website will provide a login and registration system.
2. The social network website will allow users to post their reviews of the local places, containing title, date, and content.
3. The social network website will have a feature to display all users and the city about which they post.
4. The social network website will have an option to choose a city which you are interested in, and see only relevant reviews.
5. The social media will allow a user signed in to upload and delete posts from their account.
6. The social network website will to have a feature to see all reviews posted by a specific user, by selecting their profile.
